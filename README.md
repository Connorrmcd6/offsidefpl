## About OffsideFPL

OffsideFPL is a fresh take on Fantasy Premier League (FPL), designed to raise the stakes in your mini leagues! Each week, managers compete to climb the leaderboard while avoiding suspension. You, as a manager, will receive a yellow card if any player in your starting XI commits one of the following actions:

- Misses a penalty
- Scores an own goal
- Receives a red card

You can carry a yellow card indefinitely. However, if you pick up two, you will receive a red card and be suspended for the next game week, resulting in 0 points for that week. You can "clear" a yellow card by submitting a fine approved by your league admin. Make sure to submit your fines before picking up a second yellow card, as submissions will lock once you do! After serving your suspension, your cards reset to zero.

Another objective is winning a game week. If you score the highest points in a week (provided you aren't suspended), you can choose one member to receive a yellow card. If the chosen member already has a yellow card, they will receive a red card (friendships may be tested). Alternatively, you can randomly pick three members to receive a yellow card, but there's a catchâ€”you might pick yourself in the random nomination.

Lastly, each player receives one reverse card per season. This card can be used at any point to reverse a yellow card back to the nominator.

OffsideFPL was created using the Bytesize template repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/cmcd97/bytesize). If you would like to contribute to OffsideFPL or Bytesize, both are open source!
