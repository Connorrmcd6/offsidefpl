					<p class="text-base leading-relaxed font-small-text">Managers will pick up cards for a number of reasons throughout the season, you can hold a yellow card as long as you like without any consequence but if you pick up a second yellow you will miss the following gameweek. After missing a game week, your cards are cleared. You can clear a yellow card on your own by submitting a fine of sorts (this can be whatever you want: £££, down a beer etc...). Your admin will get a prompt to approve your submission once you submit on app. How you prove this to your admin is up to you, it could be a proof of payment, video to a group chat etc...</p>

							<li>One of the players in your starting 11 misses a penalty.</li>
							<li>One of the players in your starting 11 scores an own goal.</li>
